      <br>As a tester collaborating with Blekinge Institute of Technology in the research project, I have been actively involved in the development of innovative AI-powered test automation solutions for GUI testing. Working closely with researchers from BTH and developers from Synteda, I have played an important role in testing and providing valuable feedback from both a tester's and user's perspective. My main responsibilities have been to analyze the tool's usability, report bugs, identify areas for improvement, and collaborate with developers to improve the functionality and usability of the tool, ensuring it meets the project's objectives of enabling easy-to-use, end-to-end AI-powered GUI testing. Furthermore, I have evaluated the tool for installation, project management, scalability, element handling, assertions, bug reporting, maintenance, and reporting.
